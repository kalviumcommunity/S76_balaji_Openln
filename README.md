## 🧠 What is Openln Engine?

Openln Engine is the **core learning engine** of the Openln ecosystem. It helps learners:

- Set a **goal** (e.g., "Become a Frontend Developer", "Crack FAANG Interview").
- Get a **realistic roadmap** with daily tasks and weekly milestones.
- Track progress and **level up** as they complete challenges.

This prototype was developed to validate the idea of **goal-based learning** with personalized growth tracking.
